                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6 is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately, that supports 80MHz and higher channels.
[12] Wireless access point and internet service required and sold separately. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs.
[13] Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is not supported in Belarus where Wi-Fi settings will be optimized to local regulatory requirements (802.11ac).
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6 is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately, that supports 80MHz and higher channels.
[12] Wireless access point and internet service required and sold separately. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs.
[13] Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is not supported in Belarus where Wi-Fi settings will be optimized to local regulatory requirements (802.11ac).
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6 is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately, that supports 80MHz and higher channels.
[12] Wireless access point and internet service required and sold separately. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs.
[13] Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is not supported in Belarus where Wi-Fi settings will be optimized to local regulatory requirements (802.11ac).
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6 is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately, that supports 80MHz and higher channels.
[12] Wireless access point and internet service required and sold separately. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs.
[13] Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is not supported in Belarus where Wi-Fi settings will be optimized to local regulatory requirements (802.11ac).
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6 is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately, that supports 80MHz and higher channels.
[12] Wireless access point and internet service required and sold separately. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs.
[13] Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is not supported in Belarus where Wi-Fi settings will be optimized to local regulatory requirements (802.11ac).
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6E is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately.
[12] Wi-Fi 6E requires a Wi-Fi 6E router, sold separately, to function in the 6GHz band. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6E is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs. And available in countries where 6GHz is supported.
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6E is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately.
[12] Wi-Fi 6E requires a Wi-Fi 6E router, sold separately, to function in the 6GHz band. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6E is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs. And available in countries where 6GHz is supported.
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.

                                            [11] Wi-Fi 6E is designed to support gigabit data rate when transferring files between two devices connected to the same router. Requires a wireless router, sold separately.
[12] Wi-Fi 6E requires a Wi-Fi 6E router, sold separately, to function in the 6GHz band. Availability of public wireless access points limited. Wi-Fi 6E is backwards compatible with prior 802.11 specs. And available in countries where 6GHz is supported.
[46] Bluetooth® 5.3 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.3 will function as Bluetooth® 5.2 or lower.
